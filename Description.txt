This mod uses the [url=https://github.com/sschoener/cities-skylines-detour]detours library[/url] created by [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/copernicus]cope[/url]. A big thanks to him for sharing that code, many mods on the workshop would not be possible without it.

[h1]Having Issues?[/h1]
- Make sure you have the mod enabled in the Content Manager. 
- Bugs/Crashes? Try disabling all other mods and running with just Precision Engineering enabled. If you are sure it is not caused by another mod, please post your logs in [url=http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/445589127/490125103638441491/]this thread[/url] and I'll try and take a look.
- I don't own any of the DLC so can't test with them installed. Users report that the mod works fine, however.
